# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion card](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

Responsive is not implemented yet.
